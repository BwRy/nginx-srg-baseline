  title "Non-privileged accounts on the hosting system must only access web
server security-relevant information and functions through a distinct
administrative account."
  desc  "By separating web server security functions from non-privileged users,
roles can be developed that can then be used to administer the web server.
Forcing users to change from a non-privileged account to a privileged account
when operating on the web server or on security-relevant information forces
users to only operate as a web server administrator when necessary. Operating
in this manner allows for better logging of changes and better forensic
information and limits accidental changes to the web server."
