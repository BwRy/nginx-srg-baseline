  desc  "A web server can be modified through parameter modification, patch
installation, upgrades to the web server or modules, and security parameter
changes. With each of these changes, there is the potential for an adverse
effect such as a DoS, web server instability, or hosted application instability.

    To limit changes to the web server and limit exposure to any adverse
effects from the changes, files such as the web server application files,
libraries, and configuration files must have permissions and ownership set
properly to only allow privileged users access.
